    âPlanck, On the Law of Distribution of Energy in the Normal Spectrum[6]
With this new condition, Planck had imposed the quantization of the energy of the oscillators, "a purely formal assumption actually I did
not think much about it..." in his own words,[8] but one which would revolutionize physics. Applying this new approach to Wien's displacement
law showed that the "energy element" must be proportional to the frequency of the oscillator, the first version of what is now sometimestermed
the "PlanckâEinstein relation":
In the last years of the nineteenth century, Planck was investigating the problem of black-body radiation first posed by Kirchhoff some forty
years earlier. It is well known that hot objects glow, and that hotter objects glow brighter than cooler ones. The reason is that the

# Thrift Tutorial
# Mark Slee (mcslee@facebook.com)
#
# This file aims to teach you how to use Thrift, in a .thrift file. Neato. The
# first thing to notice is that .thrift files support standard shell comments.
# This lets you make your thrift file executable and include your Thrift build
# step on the top line. And you can place comments like this anywhere you like.
#
# Before running this file, you will need to have installed the thrift compiler
# into /usr/local/bin.
