for the entropy of the oscillators.[6] To save his theory, Planck had to resort to using the then controversial theory of statistical
mechanics,[6] which he described as "an act of despair … I was ready to sacrifice any of my previous convictions about physics."[7] One of his
new boundary conditions was
    to interpret UN [the vibrational energy of N oscillators] not as a continuous, infinitely divisible quantity, but as a discrete quantity
composed of an integral number of finite equal parts. Let us call each such part the energy element ε;

With this new condition, Planck had imposed the quantization of the energy of the oscillators, "a purely formal assumption … actually I did
not think much about it…" in his own words,[8] but one which would revolutionize physics. Applying this new approach to Wien's displacement
law showed that the "energy element" must be proportional to the frequency of the oscillator, the first version of what is now sometimestermed
the "Planck–Einstein relation":
