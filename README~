their possession(passed as parameter).  Say a.txt and b.txt.  when a client makes a call to
Server A, A should remove last 10 lines from a.txt and then pass it on
to server B.  server B should prepend the incoming data to b.txt.

client --------> Server A ------> Server B
       <-----------|<----------------|

also build a client to test it.


How To Run in Eclipse :
